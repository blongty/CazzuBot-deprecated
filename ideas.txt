Reminder: if you find yourself copy-pasting code, think about making a *smaller* helper function that does the same thing.

Multiple selfroles messages:
	Message id list:
		Store as numbers in list form, but also store as attribute of corresponding group
		Example: <group name="test1" msg_id="-42">

General command speed optimization:
	Store data as attribute of the bot (Important: test if that data carries over between cogs first)
	Have a text file with a small amount of data indicating whether the main file has been changed or not
