Before you run the bot, make sure you create a file called **TOKEN_SECRET.py** at the root directory. Discord bot token can be found under your discord applications here: https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me/

*TOKEN_SECRET.py*
>TOKEN_SECRET = '<bot_token_here>'

If you have never made a bot before, you can follow this guide here made by eltrhn: https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token
